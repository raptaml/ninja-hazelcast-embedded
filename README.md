# ninja-hazelcast-embedded

This is an implementation of Ninjas Framework Cache interface for [hazelcast][2].  
Its structure is somehow based on [svenkubiaks][1] excellent MongoDB module and therefore it is an easys plugable jar, which you just have to add to your Ninja-powered projects dependencies.
